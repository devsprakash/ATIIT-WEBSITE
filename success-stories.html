                     Hassan’s journey with Atiit started in the very early days of the first batch“The Vikings”. After joining Atiit, Hassan became one of the first individuals to complete their Income Share Agreement (ISA, now Pay After Placement - PAP). Reflecting on his initial scepticism about the ISA model, his dissatisfaction with his current job and his desire for change overshadowed his concerns. His persistent inquiries to the Atiit team, coupled with their patient and sincere responses, convinced him to take the leap of faith into joining the Vikings batch.

                Support from Hassan’s family played a crucial role in his decision. Despite initial doubts, his father encouraged him to pursue his aspirations, eventually recognizing Atiit’s potential through his dedication and the efforts of the Atiit team.

                Transitioning from Atiit to his role as a Software Engineer at Sharechat, Hassan found himself surrounded by colleagues from prestigious backgrounds. As an intern, he keenly observed his seniors’ work ethic, realizing their success stemmed from relentless dedication. This realization, coupled with his experiences at Atiit, provided a solid foundation for his career growth.

                Comparing the traditional educational model with Atiit’s ISA-based approach, Hassan highlighted the latter’s emphasis on accountability. Unlike traditional systems where success feels uncertain, Atiit’s model instilled hope by aligning the institution’s success with that of its students.

                Expressing his support for implementing ISAs on a national scale in India, Hassan believed it would create a more participative learning environment. By holding educational institutions accountable for their students’ success, the ISA model could motivate educators to align their efforts with student outcomes.

                Hassan exemplifies how an ISA can transform one’s educational prospects. With his extensive knowledge and skills, Hassan is now a consultant serving Growble, poised for further career growth with improved salary packages.

                     Hassan’s journey with Atiit started in the very early days of the first batch“The Vikings”. After joining Atiit, Hassan became one of the first individuals to complete their Income Share Agreement (ISA, now Pay After Placement - PAP). Reflecting on his initial scepticism about the ISA model, his dissatisfaction with his current job and his desire for change overshadowed his concerns. His persistent inquiries to the Atiit team, coupled with their patient and sincere responses, convinced him to take the leap of faith into joining the Vikings batch.

                Support from Hassan’s family played a crucial role in his decision. Despite initial doubts, his father encouraged him to pursue his aspirations, eventually recognizing Atiit’s potential through his dedication and the efforts of the Atiit team.

                Transitioning from Atiit to his role as a Software Engineer at Sharechat, Hassan found himself surrounded by colleagues from prestigious backgrounds. As an intern, he keenly observed his seniors’ work ethic, realizing their success stemmed from relentless dedication. This realization, coupled with his experiences at Atiit, provided a solid foundation for his career growth.

                Comparing the traditional educational model with Atiit’s ISA-based approach, Hassan highlighted the latter’s emphasis on accountability. Unlike traditional systems where success feels uncertain, Atiit’s model instilled hope by aligning the institution’s success with that of its students.

                Expressing his support for implementing ISAs on a national scale in India, Hassan believed it would create a more participative learning environment. By holding educational institutions accountable for their students’ success, the ISA model could motivate educators to align their efforts with student outcomes.

                Hassan exemplifies how an ISA can transform one’s educational prospects. With his extensive knowledge and skills, Hassan is now a consultant serving Growble, poised for further career growth with improved salary packages.
